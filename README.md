# 🗑️ Garbage Detection and Reporting System

The **Garbage Detection and Reporting System** is an AI-powered application that automatically detects garbage in images/videos using **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** and generates reports through a **Flask web interface**. This project helps improve cleanliness monitoring by providing an automated way to identify garbage and notify authorities for timely action.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Detect garbage in images and videos using trained models.  
- 🌐 Flask web interface for uploading media and viewing results.  
- 📊 Report generation with detection details.  
- 🔔 Option to notify authorities about garbage presence.  
- 📂 Storage of uploaded images and generated reports.  
- ⚡ Real-time detection from live camera feed (optional).

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV – Image Processing & Object Detection

Flask – Web Framework

NumPy, Pandas – Data Handling

Matplotlib/Seaborn– Visualization (Reports)

YOLO / CNN (Optional)/Roboflow  – Deep Learning Garbage Detection


📊 Example Workflow

Upload an image/video via Flask web app.

System detects garbage using the trained ML model.

Annotated image with bounding boxes is displayed.

Report is generated with:

Image preview

Garbage detection confidence

Timestamp & Location


✅ Future Enhancements

📍 GPS-based location tagging.

📱 Mobile app integration.

☁️ Cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP).

🧠 Higher accuracy with YOLOv8 or custom-trained CNN.
